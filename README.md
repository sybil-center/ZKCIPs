# Zero-Knowledge Credentials

> ## **Objectives**

This protocol is necessary to provide the subject with the ability to confirm their attributes in the digital space without disclosing the attributes themselves. This allows the subject to avoid leaving a digital trace of their identity in the digital space and gives them complete control over their representation in the digital world.

Furthermore, in ideological terms, this protocol brings us closer to a future where the concept of [sovereign identity](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/self-sovereign-identity/blob/master/self-sovereign-identity-principles.md) makes more sense than the current state of affairs with the Verifiable Credential Data Model by W3C (hereinafter referred to as the VC specification).

Another important goal of this protocol is to create a digital environment where the subject can use digital credentials to confirm their attributes wherever possible â€“ in a centralized application, smart contract, zk application, etc. This is another crucial issue that the VC specification is unable to address.
